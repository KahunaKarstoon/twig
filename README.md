# Twig

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.22-1.

## Quick Start

```
npm install
npm run serve
```
This builds the app and runs it on a dev server. Navigate to [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200/). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Twig will look for twig-api on localhost. To get a local Twig API started, navigate to [Twig API](https://bitbucket.org/digitalrigbitbucketteam/twig-api).

### Quick Start for Twig API

```
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm start 
```

## Why Twig?

The world is becoming a more complex and interconnected space. The relationships between things are as (if not more) important than the things themselves.

We believe the ability to identify how and where people, ideas, and technology converge enables us to ask **why!?**

Our thinking in terms of how we should be able to visualise is inspired in part by [Powers of Ten](https://youtu.be/0fKBhvDjuy0)

**We want a tool that will allow us to:**

* model complex environments without artificial (hierarchical or domain) constraints
* create relationships between things that echo the real world
* create a visual way to explore and traverse these environments
* be able to see changes to the modelled environments over time

There are a lot of domain specific and commercial products out there. We coud not find one that met our specific needs so we started building Twig.

## What is Twig?

Twig is a browser-based single-page application using [D3](https://d3js.org/) to render graph visualisations.

Twig allows users to:

* create a graph model (Twiglet)
* define node (vertex) types (including attributes)
* define link (edge) types (including attributes)
* filter a view of the Twiglet based on a node entity type and attributes
* create views that show the Twiglet from a particular aspect devoid of 'noise'
* add, change, and remove nodes and links via the UI
* assign colour and images to node types
* size images (manual and automatic) based on a node's type or attribute value
* create models with nodes and attributes for future Twiglets
* edit the model for a particular Twiglet 

All Twig data is persisted in a CouchdB instance.
